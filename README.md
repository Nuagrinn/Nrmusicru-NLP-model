The project consists of two parts:

1. VK parser. This is a python script that sends an api request to get the text of the post, the author's name and the number of likes from the "new rap music" community
2. NLP model for processing and predicting the number of likes based on the content of the post.

Linear regression and ridge were used. R2=0.4 

The model needs further improvements
